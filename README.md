# Movie Project: Text Processing and Feature Extraction

This project is focused on text processing for movie-related data, specifically processing the 'tags' and 'crew' columns in a movie dataset. The goal is to extract meaningful features from the movie data and prepare it for further machine learning tasks.

## Prerequisites

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed along with some essential libraries. You can install the required dependencies using `pip` or `conda` by following the steps below.

### Installation

#### 1. Install Python
If Python is not already installed, you can download and install it from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Make sure to add Python to your system's `PATH` during installation.

#### 2. Install Dependencies

You will need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- scikit-learn (for text feature extraction)
- numpy
- ast (for safely parsing strings)

To install the necessary libraries, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
